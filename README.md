# EUREKA NAMING SERVER
Spring boot microservice for the eureka naming server load balancer.

Wonderful demonstration of the versatility of the Spring Boot.

Works by providing a load balancing platform for both any spring boot eureka client, in this case the [currency-service client](https://github.com/teamlead-agbaje/currency-service) and the [forex-service provider](https://github.com/teamlead-agbaje/forex-service)
